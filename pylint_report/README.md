This folder contains evaluations of our python code generated with Pylint.

Most detail a single package or class, however a report on the entire control-package being ran on the MOPED can be found in `plr_ENTIRE_CONTROL_PACKAGE` 

Most errors are faulty import errors (i.e. pylint is not configured properly to find them) or from imports relying on packages on the MOPED.
